# Web Dev. Lessons
Welcome to the Web Development Course. This is a neat project of mine, which I started thanks to
Grumpah and Spennorex, who wanted to learn something in the field of IT. Starting from the very
basics I plan on releasing lessons until we'll be at my limit. So I plan on working with CSS
and some CSS preprocessors, such as SASS, as well as with JS and TS, and I might as well give an
introduction to Node, Express and possibly Electron for creating apps and backends.
